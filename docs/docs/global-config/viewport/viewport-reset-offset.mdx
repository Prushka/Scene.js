import {
    SceneOnlyShort,
    GeneratorConfigBlock, sceneViewOffset09, sceneViewOffsetDefault,
} from "../../../src/components/Scene/SceneComponents";

When calculating how zoomed-out a scene is and the positions of props **when a scene is loaded** and **when a scene's viewport is reset**,
a **viewOffset** property is going to be considered to leave extra space for your props.

### Default Behavior

By default, this value is set to `0.2`.

<SceneOnlyShort {...sceneViewOffsetDefault} />

### Setting ViewOffset

The following scene uses the same config as the one above but with **viewOffset** set to `0.9`:

<GeneratorConfigBlock
    generator={
        `new GlobalConfigGenerator().viewOffset(0.9)`}
    config={
        `config.viewOffset = 0.9`} />

<SceneOnlyShort {...sceneViewOffset09} />
