This page covers the effect of setting **themeScope** to **root**.

By default, **themeScope** is set to **container** (see **[Theme](custom-theme)**).

:::info

**themeScope** can only be set to **root** or **container**:

* root: this allows switching themes using the toolbar to affect every scene in this page
* container: this restricts the theme switching functionality to the current theme

:::

### Themes with root scope

To use **root** **themeScope**, every scene in the page has to have root themeScope.

Try to change the **theme** of any scene below using the bottom left **toolbar**.

The following code snippet is applied to every scene in this page:

<GeneratorConfigBlock
    generator={
        `new GlobalConfigGenerator().themeScope('root')`}
    config={
        `config.themeScope = 'root'`} />


<SceneOnlyShort {...sceneThemeRoot1}/>

<SceneOnlyShort {...sceneThemeRoot2}/>

<SceneOnlyShort {...sceneThemeRoot3}/>
