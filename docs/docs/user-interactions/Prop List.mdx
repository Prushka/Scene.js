## Prop List

This list shows all filtered props. By **default**, it displays all props in this frame.

* Clicking a prop will display/hide its **Prop Dialog** (toggle selected prop)
* Clicking the Prop List's right collapse/expand button will **hide/show** the Prop List

### Filter

The filter button will give you a dialog popup.

You can filter props by **prop type** and **search text**.

Every time you **selected/deselect a prop type** and/or **enter/clear the search TextField**:
1. The filter dialog will display filtered props only
2. The prop list itself will display filtered props only
3. The viewport will display filtered props only

:::info

If search TextField contains nothing, it has no effect.

### Reset

This button next to Filter resets the filter.

All props will be displayed once you click it.
