## Dialog

There are 2 ways to open a prop dialog:

1. Click a prop in the **Prop List**
2. Click a prop in the viewport

:::tip

If a tab doesn't contain any value (will be detected by the library), it may be ignored.

However, developers can configure the library so that it always shows all tabs in the **Prop Dialog Header**.
