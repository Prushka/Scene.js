## Timeline

:::info

The progress bar will only display and animate when the user goes forward by 1 frame.

:::


The animation speed and how long it takes to go to the **next** frame depend on the prop config.

However, if the user goes backward or forward by more than 1 frames, the animation speed and how long it takes depend on the global config.
