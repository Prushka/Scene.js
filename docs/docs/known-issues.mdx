1. The viewport animation doesn't work on **Webkit Browsers**. (This doesn't affect the timeline progress bar animation).
    * This may be caused by WebKit or issues with namespace elements (I've created the svg viewport using NS tho).
2. The **search function** in this docs website **doesn't** cover all pages. Please don't rely on it.
    * A fix can be found using a cloud or self-hosted DocSearch integration. I don't have time to do it at the moment.
